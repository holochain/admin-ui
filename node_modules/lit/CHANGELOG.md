## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

## 2.0.0-rc.4

### Patch Changes

- [#2103](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/2103) [`15a8356d`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/15a8356ddd59a1e80880a93acd21fadc9c24e14b) - Updates the `exports` field of `package.json` files to replace the [subpath
  folder
  mapping](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/packages.html#packages_subpath_folder_mappings)
  syntax with an explicit list of all exported files.

  The `/`-suffixed syntax for subpath folder mapping originally used in these
  files is deprecated. Rather than update to the new syntax, this change replaces
  these mappings with individual entries for all exported files so that (a) users
  must import using extensions and (b) bundlers or other tools that don't resolve
  subpath folder mapping exactly as Node.js does won't break these packages'
  expectations around how they're imported.
