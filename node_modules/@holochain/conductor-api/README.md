A nodejs implementation of the Holochain conductor API.

# Conductor API documentation

Holochain's conductor API is under active development.  This node module tracks that development fairly closely but sometimes gets behind.

# Install

To install from NPM, run
```bash
npm install --save-exact @holochain/conductor-api
```

> Note, this code is still under alpha development and npm releases are pre-releases with `dev` tags meaning they will not use full semantic versioning, and you may wish to lock to an exact version of the library for that reason, as shown in the above command.

## Sample usage

### Use AdminWebsocket
```typescript
  const admin = await AdminWebsocket.connect(`http://localhost:8000`, TIMEOUT)
  await admin.generateAgentPubKey()
```

### Use AppWebsocket
```typescript
  const signalCb = (signal: AppSignal) => {
    // impl...
    resolve()
  }

  const TIMEOUT = 12000
  // default timeout is set to 12000
  const client = await AppWebsocket.connect(`http://localhost:${appPort}`, 12000, signalCb)

  // default timeout set here (30000) will overwrite the defaultTimeout(12000) set above
  await client.callZome({
   cap: null,
   cell_id,
   zome_name: "test_zome",
   fn_name: 'test_emitter_fn',
   provenance: fakeAgentPubKey('TODO'),
   payload: null,
  }, 30000)
```

# Holochain Compatibility

This version of `holochain-conductor-api` is currently working with
- `holochain/holochain` 0.0.114 at commit: [43e5a2ca5a7bf59a7b1beff1f54a13af1bf7ac52](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/commit/43e5a2ca5a7bf59a7b1beff1f54a13af1bf7ac52)
- hdk version 0.0.114 from crates.io

If updating this code, please make changes to the git `rev/sha` above.  (You can get this from `hn-introspect` after updating the holonix-hash)

## Running tests

You need a version (`stable` toolchain) of Rust available.

You need `holochain` and `hc` on your path, best to get them from nix with `nix-shell`

To perform the pre-requisite DNA compilation steps, and run the nodejs test, run:
```bash
./run-test.sh
```
